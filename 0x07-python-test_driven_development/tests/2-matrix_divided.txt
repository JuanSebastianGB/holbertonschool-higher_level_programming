UNIT TEST FOR MODULE 2-matrix_divided.PY
========================================

In this module is implemented a function to divide all the elements of a gived matrix by a div number ``matrix_divided(matrix, div)```

=============
HOW TO USE IT
=============

``matrix_divided(...)`` Return matrix with the values divided by a gived input.

# Checking all values with an expected output, but getting .2 decimals 
    >>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided
    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [2, 4, 6],
    ...     [8, 10, 12]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 2))  
    [[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]]

# Checking with decimals and negative numbers
    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [1.1, 4, 6],
    ...     [8, 10, -12]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))  
    [[0.37, 1.33, 2.0], [2.67, 3.33, -4.0]]

===============
Checking div
=============== 

Div like string

# Checking with decimals and negative numbers
    >>> matrix = [[1.1, 4, 6],[8, 10, -12]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, "3"))  
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: div must be a number

Div is 0
# Checking with decimals and negative numbers
    >>> matrix = [[1.1, 4, 6],[8, 10, -12]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 0))  
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

===============
Checking Matrix
=============== 

# Matrix must be a list
    >>> matrix = None
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 5))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

# Matrix can't be an string
    >>> print(matrix_divided("I am a matrix", 5))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

# Matrix must be a list with lists with numbers
    >>> matrix = [[1.1, 4, []],[8, 10, "-12"]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 5))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

# Matrix can't be empty
    >>> matrix = []
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 5))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

# The lists iniside Matrix can't be empty neither
    >>> matrix = [[]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 5))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

# The list elements only can be numbers
    >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], ["5", 1, -90]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 5))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

# Checking all the rows the same size
    >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 5))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size
